## OpenWeatherMap

This is an app to query the [OpenWeatherMap api](http://openweathermap.org/) and display the results on an HTML page. 

### Technologies Used

- [**AJAX**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)) for querying, so that the data is presented to the user on the same page.
- [**Express**](http://expressjs.com/) as the server which queries the API through [**Needle**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/needle).
